# John Conway's Game of Life
### Rest in Piece John Conway 1937â€“2020

This repository is a tribute to the famous mathematician John Horton Conway.

Conway's Game of Life is a single player game in which a set of rules can give birth to unique animations.
Rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies. [Underpopulation]
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies. [Overcrowding]
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors continues to the next generation. [Stable populations]
4. Any dead cells of exactly three live neighbors will come back to life. [Reproduction]

### Given these rules we are able to make unique patterns and animations.
